A directive for handling permissions.

A user can only query a field decorated with this directive if they have any of the
roles or permissions specified in its `roles` and `permissions` arguments. If they
don;t, the directive raises an exception.

For example, consider the following type:

```
type Proposal {
  content(proposalCode: ProposalCode): String!
                @permittedFor(roles=[PROPOSAL_OWNER], permissions=[VIEW_ALL_PROPOSALS])
}
```

The content field can be queried if the user is an owner of the specified proposal or
if they may view all proposals.

The directive uses the arguments of the field resolver as required.
